# Bharat Welfare AI

Bharat Welfare AI is an intelligent platform designed to streamline the discovery of Indian government welfare schemes for citizens. Utilizing the Google Gemini 2.5 Flash model, the application provides high-precision eligibility analysis by reasoning through demographic data, including age, income, state, and occupation.

## Key Features

* **AI-Powered Reasoning**: Leverages large language models to interpret complex government policy nuances in real-time.
* **Universal Benefit Logic**: Accurately identifies universal benefits, such as the Ayushman Bharat 70+ health cover, which bypasses traditional income filters.
* **Strict Enrollment Validation**: Enforces precise age-based "Hard Gates" for schemes like Atal Pension Yojana (APY) and PM-SYM.
* **Negative Case Transparency**: Provides clear explanations when a user is ineligible, detailing specific criteria gaps like income thresholds or age windows.
* **Responsive Architecture**: Built with a modular Node.js backend and a Vite-powered React frontend for optimal performance.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Axios
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Morgan
* **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai SDK)
* **Environment**: Dotenv for secure API key management

To make your repository user-friendly for judges and testers, you should include a dedicated section for sample inputs. This allows anyone to verify the AI's complex reasoning logic quickly.

## Sample Test Cases

You can use these JSON objects to test the system's logic via the frontend form or API testing tools like Postman.

### 1. Universal Senior Citizen Rule
Tests the 2026 policy where citizens aged 70+ get health cover regardless of wealth.
* **Input:**
  ```json
  {
    "age": 75,
    "income": 2500000,
    "state": "Maharashtra",
    "occupation": "Retired"
  }

```

* **Expected Result:** Eligible for **Ayushman Bharat (PM-JAY)** Senior Card.

### 2. Strict Pension Enrollment Gate

Tests the 18-40 age enrollment window for pension schemes.

* **Input:**
```json
{
  "age": 41,
  "income": 180000,
  "state": "Tamil Nadu",
  "occupation": "Unorganized Worker"
}

```

* **Expected Result:** **Ineligible** for APY and PM-SYM due to exceeding the enrollment age gate.

### 3. Occupation-Specific Mapping

Tests if specific job titles trigger the correct micro-credit schemes.

* **Input:**
```json
{
  "age": 35,
  "income": 140000,
  "state": "Gujarat",
  "occupation": "Street Vendor"
}

```

* **Expected Result:** Primary recommendation for **PM SVANidhi**.

### 4. Education and Student Priority

Tests if the AI shifts from labor welfare to educational scholarships.

* **Input:**
```json
{
  "age": 19,
  "income": 0,
  "state": "Delhi",
  "occupation": "Student"
}

```

* **Expected Result:** Eligible for **National Scholarship Portal (NSP)** and **PM YASASVI**.

### 5. High-Income Filtering

Tests the system's ability to deny poverty-based benefits to high earners.

* **Input:**
```json
{
  "age": 30,
  "income": 1500000,
  "state": "Karnataka",
  "occupation": "Software Engineer"
}

```


* **Expected Result:** `eligible_schemes` array should be **empty**, with detailed rejection notices.

```

### Why include this?
* **Demonstrates Robustness:** It proves you have accounted for edge cases.
* **Ease of Judging:** Judges can copy-paste these to see the AI's "brain" in action instantly.
* **Validation:** It confirms your `0` income handling and age-gate logic are working as intended.


# Disclaimer

This application is a prototype developed for hackathon purposes. Eligibility results are generated by AI and should be cross-verified with official government portals such as National Portal of India or specific scheme websites like pmjay.gov.in.
